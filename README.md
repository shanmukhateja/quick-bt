# Quick BT

## Decription
This project was created so I could quickly toggle Bluetooth without having to go to Settings > Devices > Bluetooth
on Windows 10 laptop.

## Usage

### Steps:

- Install [Python 3](https://python.org/) 

- Clone this repository, open `cmd` and navigate to the project.

- Need to install [infi.systray](https://github.com/Infinidat/infi.systray) by running:

     `pip install infi.systray --user`

- Launch `src\main.py`

### Note:

- Windows executables will be available in near future.
- If it doesn't work, try running script in an elevated prompt (run `cmd` as admin).
